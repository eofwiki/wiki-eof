# Leaderboard

For those who wish to prove they are the apex predators in Engines of Fury, Leaderboard offers a direct path to glory. It is the ultimate measure of a player's skill, persistence, and dominance.

Your rank is determined by a comprehensive points system that rewards all significant in-game actions. This system creates a complete performance profile for every Raider, tallied to determine your rank against every other player in the game.

| Action                            | Points Awarded |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Killing another player            | TBA            |
| Killing a boss   | TBA            |
| Successfully extracting           | TBA            |
| Killing an enemy | TBA            |
| Dying                             | TBA            |

To maintain a fair and competitive environment, the Leaderboard resets completely every week, ensuring that new players always have a fighting chance to climb the ranks. Every week, the race to the top begins anew.
