# Recovery of lost assets

1. DO NOT CLOSE / RESTART THE GAME
2. On your computer, open the following folder: `WINDOWS: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Game Masterminds OU\Engines of Fury MAC: ~/Library/Logs/Game Masterminds OU/Engines of Fury/Player.log`\
   If you're using Windows, simply paste the following path into the File Explorer address bar to navigate directly to the correct folder:`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Game Masterminds OU\Engines of Fury`
3. Find the file named Player.log and make a copy of it.
4. Go to the [Engines of Fury Discord](https://discord.com/invite/enginesoffury) and create a support ticket.
5. Attach the copied Player.log file to your ticket.

P.S. if you did close/restart the game prior to copying Player.log, please create a ticket naming your Epic Games ID, IMX Passport ID, approximate time of error occurence (but please bear in mind that without Player.log the recovery will take significantly more time).
