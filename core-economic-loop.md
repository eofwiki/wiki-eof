# Core Economic Loop

In Engines of Fury, each gameplay loop is a critical link in the chain of progression, and it all begins with ensuring you are the predator, not the prey. This path allows for multiple player archetypes—the cautious PvE farmer, the aggressive PvP hunter, and the savvy resource merchant—to find their niche and prosper.

**Step 1: Foundation**\
First, you must become a formidable force. This foundational gameplay loop is non-negotiable. It revolves around crafting superior [weapons](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/weapons) and [armor](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/equipment), undertaking missions to hone your [abilities](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/talent-system), and finding [Medusal Cells](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/materials) to unlock essential [talents](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/talent-system). If you are entering competitive zones unprepared, you are no longer a player—you are the loot for those who did prepare.

**Step 2: The Hunt**\
Once properly armed and dangerous, your objective is to find critical resources in the wastelands. Explore the high-stakes maps of [Fairwater and Cliffside](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/maps) to secure Council Caches if you are an [Initiated Raider](https://wiki.eof.gg/utility-nfts/initiates-pass). For the most skilled ones, the ultimate prize is to take down other players, defeating them in skillful PVP encounters to claim their [ALLOY](https://wiki.eof.gg/economy/dual-currencies/gear) and [Faction Shards](https://wiki.eof.gg/utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes).

**Step 3: Market Mastery**\
The spoils of your raids, particularly [Faction Shards](https://wiki.eof.gg/utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes), are rare in-game assets. Players can engage in transfers or swaps of those assets with other players, including via external platforms (NFT Marketplaces), carried out independently at the players’ own discretion and risk. That way players can acquire the specific ones they need to complete sets. This way cooperation between players allows bypassing the randomness of loot drops by engaging with the game’s ecosystem.

**Step 4: Crafting & Unlocking**\
With a complete set of Faction Shards, you can craft a [Faction Lockbox](utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md). The final step of this loop takes place in your [hideout](key-economic-hubs/hideout.md), where you must power up the [Engine](game/hideout/engine.md) with a [Core NFT](utility-nfts/engine-and-its-cores.md). This module is the only technology capable of cracking open these secure [Faction Lockboxes](utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md) to reveal the [ALLOY](economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) resources they hold.

**Step 5: Conversion**\
[Trading Station](key-economic-hubs/trading-station.md) is where your in-game success translates to tangible progression. This is the exclusive hub for converting your accumulated [ALLOY](economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) assets into the [FURY](economy/dual-currencies/fury.md) which then can be used for buying powerful upgrades, [necessary fuel](game/materials.md), crafting [materials](game/materials.md) and a variety of other items.

**Step 6: Dominance**\
For the elite, the ultimate challenge awaits. All of your in-game actions contribute to the weekly [Leaderboards](leaderboard.md). Dominate the competition through consistent performance in raiding, crafting, and surviving to claim a dominant position in the [Leaderboard](leaderboard.md).
