<summary>Core Gameplay loop</summary>

The player's main objective is to infiltrate a location, collect valuable loot, and safely extract to their hideout. At the hideout, players can craft upgrades for their character, equipment, and the hideout itself - improving their chances of survival and increasing access to better items.

<summary>Battle mechanics</summary>

Combat in Engines of Fury follows familiar top-down mechanics, with success largely based on player skill, reaction time, and equipment. Encounters with other players are treated the same as enemy fights.\
\
Friendly fire is fully enabled, meaning players can harm both allies and themselves during combat. Abilities & all weapon attacks can cause self-damage if used without caution.

Players can equip a second weapon and switch (X) between the two to adapt to threats. Switching takes a brief moment and is not instant.

Due to the top-down view, players have limited visibility. Combat outside the screen is indicated through mini-map pings and visual sound cues, helping players decide whether to engage or avoid conflict.

Players can dodge incoming attacks, with dodge distance and cooldown based on character stats. Agile builds allow for faster and longer dodges, while heavier, defense-focused builds have reduced mobility.

<summary>Scavenging</summary>

Scavenging is the main method for acquiring crafting materials and equipment. Maps are filled with loot - ranging from scrap to fully assembled weapons and armor - often guarded by various enemies. The core objective is to defeat these enemies and extract with the loot.

Loot can be found directly on the ground, in small caches, or large chests. To collect it, players must approach and hold the action key (F). This triggers a brief interaction timer, the length of which depends on the loot type. Taking damage during this timer cancels the action, requiring the area to be cleared before safely looting.

Caches open a loot window. During this interaction, players cannot perform other actions and are vulnerable to attacks. The window can be quickly closed with the close button or Esc key.

If a player dies during scavenging, they lose their entire inventory and 2–3 randomly selected equipped items.

<details>

<summary>Co-op</summary>

In Co-op Mode, two players can join forces by teaming up directly from their hideout to create a shared lobby. Once grouped, they can queue for battles as a duo. When a match is found, both players spawn together at the same location, enabling tight coordination, shared strategy, and true side-by-side combat throughout the encounter.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Inventory</summary>

The inventory is represented as a fixed 42-slot grid displayed on the right side of the screen, adjacent to the [equipment](equipment.md) panel. Players can move and engage in combat while the inventory is open.

Items occupy between 1 and 6 grid squares depending on their physical size. Identical items are stackable up to a maximum of 99 per stack.

Items can be dragged from the inventory to equipment slots to be equipped, or onto the ground to drop them. If the inventory is full, players cannot pick up additional items.

Each item also has an assigned weight value. Each character has a maximum carrying capacity determined by their stats. Exceeding this weight limit causes the character to gradually slow down, reducing both dash speed and distance.

<details>

<summary>Ammo</summary>

All weapons require ammo to fire; without it, they won’t function. Ammo is stored in the inventory and is specific to weapon types - e.g., rocket launchers cannot use assault rifle rounds. Ammo type does not affect weapon damage or effects, which are determined by the weapon itself.

Weapons have varying magazine sizes and must be reloaded either manually or when empty. Reloading takes time during which firing is disabled.

Ammo is easy to craft, and players are expected to stock up before entering a raid.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Healing</summary>

Healing in Engines of Fury is intentionally limited to reflect the game’s harsh survival setting. There is no passive health regeneration, and no items provide it.

Players can craft healing packs in their hideout and bring them into raids. These packs restore a small amount of health over a few seconds, during which the player cannot move. If interrupted, healing stops and the pack is consumed.

Most healing comes with trade-offs. Using a health pack often applies a lasting negative effect - such as reduced max health, movement speed, or accuracy -balancing immediate recovery with long-term risk.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Extraction</summary>

To escape with their loot, players must extract by finding an extraction point.

Extraction Points are scattered across the map. To locate one, players can activate the mini-map (M). After a 5-second delay, nearby extraction point appear as blue dot.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Crafting</summary>

After extraction, players return to their hideout to convert scrap materials into usable items. Different crafting modules specialize in creating various item types, such as consumables or equipment.

Crafting transforms materials into items or higher-tier components and takes time, which can be reduced by upgrading the crafting modules.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Upgrading</summary>

Players can upgrade crafted or found items to increase their rarity and effectiveness. Upgrading does not create new items but enhances existing ones. Unlike crafting, upgrading is instant with no wait time.
