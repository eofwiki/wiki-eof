# Engine

Engine itself is not a complex machine - readily available to most in Stoneport due to its similarities to a regular crafting bench. What sets it apart is its key component - the Core.

This core allows the module to crack open a lockbox and safely extract the ALLOY encased within it. Without a core, lockboxes are essentially impenetrable.
