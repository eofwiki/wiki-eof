# Engine

Engine itself is not a complex machine - readily available to most in Stoneport due to its similarities to a regular crafting bench. What sets it apart is its key component - the Core.

This core allows the module to crack open a [lockbox](../../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md) and safely extract the [$ALLOY](../../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) encased within it. Without a core, [lockboxes](../../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md) are essentially impenetrable.
