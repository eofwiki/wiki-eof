# Scavenger mode

**What is Scavenger mode?**
\
Scavenger Mode is an alternate way to participate in raids, designed for players who want to engage in risk-free exploration or are running low on resources. In this mode, players enter the battle with a basic, low-tier loadout of weapons and equipment & ammo, instead of their personal gear. They receive this loadout immediately upon entering the battle, starting the raid equipped and ready to fight. This mode is ideal for newcomers or those looking to recover supplies without risking their primary loadout.\
\
**A great entry point for beginners**
\
Scavenge, survive, and bring enough loot to kickstart your hideout upgrades. Scavenger Mode offers an accessible way for new players to gather resources and make steady progress, while giving experienced raiders a chance to explore and earn without risking their high-value gear.\
