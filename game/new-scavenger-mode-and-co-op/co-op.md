# Co-op

**Co-op Mode (Up to 2 Players)**

In Co-op mode, up to two players can team up in their hideout and form a lobby together. From there, they can search for a battle as a team. Once a match is found, both players will spawn together at the same location, allowing them to coordinate and fight side by side.\
