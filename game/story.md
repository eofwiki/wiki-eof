# Story

### **Fairwater**

Fairwater was once a small farming community situated on a peninsula somewhere in the Midwest US. Residents lived in trailers scattered along dirt roads, surrounded by fields of corn and wheat and mostly working in the nearby pork farm. A single bridge connected them to the mainland, serving as their only link in and out of town.

At the center of the town was the Langston family. Wealthy and influential, the Langstons controlled most of the farmland, employing villagers as workers. Jeremiah Langston, the family patriarch, was respected but feared, known for strict control over his land, employees and even within internal family matters.

#### **Arrival of the Apocalypse**

When the asteroid struck and the mutation started to overtake, chaos spread quickly. Jeremiah ordered the destruction of the bridge to isolate Fairwater, protecting it from outside threats. At first, the decision appeared successful, as mutants struggled to cross the lake. But this was short lived and the isolation soon revealed other dangers.

The peninsula’s vegetation started growing rapidly and became unusually aggressive. Crops twisted and grew uncontrollably, while trees and underbrush overtook homes and roads. Fairwater soon transformed from farmland into a dense and unnatural wilderness.

#### **Jeremiah’s Secret**

Afterward, villagers began disappearing without explanation. Fear and suspicion grew. Rumors surfaced that Jeremiah Langston had discovered a mutant creature hidden deep in the woods behind his estate. Stories claimed Jeremiah began enamored with the creature as something he had never seen before. They say he started raising it and offering villagers to the beast in the hopes of it later protecting the Langston family from the apocalypse that had ensued.

Residents reported hearing screams at night from the direction of the Langston estate, along with inhuman growls. Although terrified, no one confronted Jeremiah, afraid of becoming the next to vanish. All they could do was attempt to hide somewhere in the peninsula.

#### **The Haunting of Fairwater**

Today, Fairwater is abandoned. Rusted farming equipment remains scattered among the overgrown fields, and trailers stand empty. The Langston estate sits at the far edge of town, partially hidden by wild growth.

Raiders who venture to Fairwater claim they feel watched, as though something still lives deep in the woods behind the Langston house. Jeremiah’s fate remains unknown, but his legacy haunts the peninsula. Treasure hunters who enter Fairwater often fail to return, hinting that Jeremiah Langston’s monstrous secret still waits in the woods.

### Cliffside

#### AFB 42-A

The area was once known as Air Force Base 42-A - a heavily guarded underground missile silo. A pinnacle of military might, this desert compound stood as a guarantor of peace for decades. After the asteroid strike and the ensuing collapse of the military, the silo was swiftly abandoned. Its secrets left to be buried beneath the sand.

#### **Rise of The Raiders**

The deserted silo, rich with valuable materials and untapped resources, became a beacon for countless factions vying for control. The desert transformed into a warzone, soaked with the blood of the ambitious. From this chaos emerged **The Raiders -** a cannibalistic society seemingly warped by the Medusal mutations although still appearing human. Their minds twisted, they worshipped deities crafted from scavenged scrap, conducted human sacrifices in dark rituals, and built secretive villages amidst the dunes. Feared and formidable, The Raiders dominated the wasteland with a never before seen thirst for blood.

#### **The Great Disappearance**

Without warning, The Raiders vanished overnight. Their sudden departure remains one of the deserts greatest mysteries. Some whisper they fled from the ever-strengthening mutated creatures; others have said they grew wary of the dormant nuclear missile lying in wait. The Verdant Vanguard believe they eventually fully transformed into a mutant army. Their fate and destination are unknown, leaving only legends in their wake.

#### **A New Era of Peril**

With The Raiders gone, the missile silo has become a hotspot for scavengers and opportunists. The Council moves swiftly to capitalize on the trove of precious materials, but the area is anything but safe. Danger lurks in every shadow, and the cost of life is steep. Only the boldest dare to tread where an entire faction once ruled - and vanished without a trace.
