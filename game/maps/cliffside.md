The mutation have spread to the area resulting in numerous unpredictable behaviors. The mutation itself is an enormous living fungus-like organism that is slowly overtaking the globe.\
Each time the player enters the map, it will be somewhat randomized as the infection is constantly changing and moving. This results in numerous “hives” of the infection appearing in different parts of the map each time. The hives will have super hard enemies within them and completely unique loot. In addition, organic bridges and other roadblocks also appear randomly. These are not reflected within the player’s map and thus always provide with an element of unpredictability to the game.

The top area will house a “Nightmare mode” style location that will be the source of the infection. It will be extremely difficult to survive, but will provide the players with much better rewards.
