<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Faction</th><th width="486.3359375">Background</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><strong>Raggy Mei</strong></td><td>Outlander</td><td>Raggy Mei is a survivor from the first impact. Though she was a young child at the time, she grew up in the aftermath with parents distrustful of the Council and primary narratives. As a result, Raggy Mei has a very negative view of The Council and has no interest in helping them. Instead, she directs the player to the ambassadors of each of the Factions, in the hopes the player will convince them of the evils of The Council. She speaks with a Southern drawl due to growing up in Georgia in a mixed family (white American mother, Chinese father). She's a zen taoist ultra-conservative prepper with a strong distrust for authority... Including The Council of Stoneport. While Raggie May avoids Stoneport, sometimes the necessity for supplies draws her in. She is not afraid to use her feminine attributes to get a better bargain, or calm a failing negotiation, as she does not like the idea of having to fight her way out of the heavily policed city.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><strong>John Jacobs Smith</strong></td><td>The Forged</td><td>To call him a hillbilly would be a kindness. JJ has lived within the mountains of stone his whole life, mining for ore and slowly forming the metal exoskeleton that almost fully encases him now. He is an adherent to the might-makes-right ideology and does not suffer fools who do not feel the same. To those who show respect, he is an ardent mentor, demonstrating the power and satisfaction of crafting your own weapons and armors. To those who would spit on his gifts, he can be a brutal monster. When not hammering out new pieces of armor for his initiates (metallurgy is somewhat of a religion for him), he can be seen strumming his banjo.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><strong>Jia Li Duhai (毒叶 佳丽)</strong></td><td>The Verdant</td><td>A stunningly beautiful advocate for the Verdant way of life. She epitomizes the beauty of humanity in perfect fusion with the medusal infused plants of Earth. Not unlike the dryads of mythology, Jia Li entices anyone who will listen to come into the forest and experience the new natural world in ways none of the other factions can. To live beneath the trees, breathe the air with your own lungs, and see the sun, moon, skies and sea again is a dangerously enticing pitch for those who spend most of their lives beneath ground in fear of the new atmosphere above.Jia Li believes ardently in everyone embracing these mutations so that humanity can live above ground together once more and it is difficult for most to ignore her arguments. She also emphasizes her own beauty and demureness to lure people into underestimating her, when in fact she could dead lift a dump truck and chuck it 30 meters.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><strong>Samara Rahotep</strong></td><td>Echelon of Eternity</td><td>As fervent a believer as there ever was, Samara’s Egyptian heritage and sharp features work perfectly with her ardent sermons about humanity’s true savior, God. It is impossible not to believe her conviction and dangerous to fall into the rhythms of her speech as she expounds the virtues of The Echelon of Eternity, and how one day they will retame the Earth in His image as was intended. For Samara and the Eternals, this is all a test, and the believers will be GREATLY rewarded. Salvation awaits, if you’ll only take her beautiful white-gloved hand.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><strong>Doctor Robert Kurikama</strong></td><td>The Helix</td><td>A geneticist with Japanese heritage, Robert grew up in the science labs of a commune on the outskirts of the military base his forebearers survived the apocalypse in. There, all scientists work together, utilizing the medusal cells to advance science in leaps and bounds. Creating an abundance of food for trade, and genetic modifications to help humanity survive the difficult circumstances of the surface world. Now he has been sent to recruit people back to the Commune to help with the shortage of people to experiment on… I mean, to help the Commune survive.<br>Doctor Kurikami has a calm, almost to the point of disturbing, demeanor. However, he is quick to extoll the virtues of living in a Helix commune to those who are interested in the extreme mutations they can offer.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zeer Uratell</strong></td><td>The One (Usurpers)</td><td>Zeer Uratell is from a genetic line of Sentinels crafted by The One. They are Watchers who are given a seed world to watch over and granted immortality, as well as extraordinary omnikinetic powers through genetic selection and manipulation pre-birth. Zeer has been on earth since the first impact when the seeds of humanity were planted, and helped usher in the death of the dinosaurs in the second impact to help humanity take the surface world. Because of her power, she is able to manipulate her own appearance on the genetic level and appears as an unimaginably beautiful human female. However, her strength, agility, and durability are far beyond match for anything that exists on earth. In essence a God, Zeer's purpose is to help guide humanity indirectly so that they can achieve greatness on their own through a multi-million year process of evolutionary progress. While Zeer cannot predict the ultimate outcome, Earth had special potential according to the High Command and Zeer takes her position as guide and guardian very seriously. When the Third Impact occurred and it was clearly not by Her design... She took that personally.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><strong>Dark Councilor</strong></td><td>The Council</td><td>The Dark Councilor was originally Dallas Brenmore, a Stoneport native whose parents moved there from Texas. However, around 20 years ago when the other members of The Council were being replaced by their nepo-children, Dallas was unknowingly taken over by a Medusella. In an attempt to extend his own life, Dallas absorbed too many Medusal Cells and the entity known as Stars Beyond Time overtook him and displaced his mind.<br><br>From that day forward, The Dark Councilor was born. Still known within the council as Dallas Brenmore, Stars recognized that Dallas outward appearance was changing and began wearing large dark cloaks to cover the changes at all times. Glimpses at Stars face reveal an incredibly pale white, nearly translucent skin (and growing increasingly so by the year). Over the years since the transition, The Dark Councilor has also removed several members of The Council who knew Dallas Bernmore well enough that they might discover their transformation. An accident here or a corruption scandal there, and soon enough there was no one left who knew the original Dallas Brenmore well enough to know that Stars Beyond Time was not him. Yet, The Dark Councilor has quickly become the head of The Council, directing nearly all of its movements.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><strong>Ranger Bourdain</strong></td><td>Army Corps of Engineers</td><td>Ranger Tony Bourdain was originally a chef in the Army Corps of Engineers. He loved nothing more than exploring new regions and finding new ingredients to work with for his special stews. Enlisting at an early age, his aptitude for propane powered engineering set him on the “special list” for joining the Army Corps of Engineers, and his love for food made him the most popular guy in the South Atlantic Division.<br><br>After the Impact, Ranger Bourdain was one of the few Rangers left and quickly advanced to Chief of Engineers due to his ability to innovate with very few resources. His primary goal is to remove the curse of the virus from humanity, and most of his actions and goals for the A.C.E. reflect that.</td></tr></tbody></table>
