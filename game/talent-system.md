**Abilities**

<details>

<summary>Active Abilities</summary>

Active ability is a gameplay action which requires player’s input to be initiated. All abilities have their unique effects, cooldowns and deplete energy on use. Each active ability slot has a keybind, default being \[RMB], \[Q], \[E] & \[Space].

* \[RMB], \[Q] and \[E] - active ability slots with player’s chosen abilities to be assigned into
* \[Space] - activates “Dash” ability. This is default active ability, provided from the start and cannot be replaced.

**Acquisition**

Active abilities can be acquired by activating the skills in the skill tree by using the surgery table hideout module.

**Assignation**

Whenever skill with an active ability is activated in the skill tree, it provides access to its respective ability which can then be assigned into any active ability bar slot. Same ability can only be assigned into 1 slot. Assigned skills’ borders are visually distinct from the unassigned skills.

<summary>Passive Abilities</summary>

Most of the skills provide static character parameters like attribute and stat increases while the minority provide more interesting, conditional and situational passive abilities. Passive abilities are instant or temporary combat effects which trigger or activate under certain conditions. They do not have any cooldown and do not deplete energy, unless being a part of its effect.

**Skill tree**

<summary>Structure</summary>

The tree consists of a spectrum of skills spread out in 3 different axis according to Character’s Primary Attributes:

* Strength
* Agility
* Intelligence

**Strength** axis skills are focused on pure damage dealing and survivability.

**Agility** axis skills are focused on mobility and intricate attacks.

**Intelligence** axis skills are focused on disabling/weaking enemies and resistances to DMG elements.

Player can choose skills in between axis - resulting in mixed approach in between axis skills.

Skills that are closer to the center provide weaker and universal balances.

💡 Example: Damage increased by 10%

Skills that are further down any direction are very powerful, but very situational or provide a weakness in some form in addition to its main effect.

💡 Example: While not moving, you deal 20% more damage, but receive 10% more damage.

<summary>Rules &#x26; Progression</summary>

Player starts at the skill node in the middle of the skill tree. In order to activate a skill node, player must use the surgery table hideout module, find a skill node which connects to the starting node or any other node that is already active, make sure that it has an empty slot and place the mutagen into it. Once activated, player is immediately granted with that node’s effect and unlocks additional pathways of nodes.

ℹ️ Mutagen is a purified form of “alien material” found in raids.

Player can also deactivate skills one by one in such a manner that after deactivating a skill the skill requirements for the rest of the skills are still met (pathways). No refunds are given for deactivating a skill.

**Skill Tree Reset**

During game updates which include skill tree pathway changes or adds additional rules or skills which in some way might break the current skill tree, the whole skill tree is reset and player is refunded with all materials that were used for activated skills in the old version of the skill tree.
