# In-Game Economy overview

Welcome to the world of Engines of Fury. In this post-apocalyptic, top-down extraction shooter, every raid into the mutant-infested wastelands is a gamble. You stake your gear and your life against the chance of extracting with a fortune in scavenged in-game resources. If you die, you lose what you carry. If you succeed, the spoils are yours. This core gameplay loop is the foundation upon which our in-game economy is built.

While EoF Season 2: Initiate's introduces the foundational elements of in-game economy, it is crucial to understand that this is merely the first stage of a much larger economic framework. Our long-term vision is a completely player-driven economy—a complex, self-sustaining ecosystem resting on four main pillars: Guilds, Convenience, Cosmetics, and Asset Ownership. With this season, we are laying the key foundations.
