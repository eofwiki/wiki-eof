**What It Is:**&#x20;

FURY is an on-chain token that reflects in-game progress and skill. It is designed support convenience, access, and advanced gameplay features within the game’s economy.

**How You Get It:**&#x20;

Players can acquire FURY through gameplay events, or by exchanging [ALLOY](alloy.md) at the [Trading Station](../../key-economic-hubs/trading-station.md). Outside the game, players may also obtain FURY at their own discretion, either directly from third-party holders or through external platforms such as exchanges that independently choose to list it. The company itself does not conduct any investment offerings or token placements, and any external acquisitions are entirely at the players’ own risk.

**Its Utility:**&#x20;

FURY can be exchanged for certain utility [NFTs](../../utility-nfts/) (described in the [NFT section](../../utility-nfts/)) that unlock specific in-game features and progression options, as well as for premium gameplay items such as Globs of Fuel to power the [hideout](../../key-economic-hubs/hideout.md) or Trader Coins to obtain rare materials. In future updates, FURY will also be required to convert [weapons](../../game/weapons.md) and [armor](../../game/equipment.md) into on-chain digital assets.

**Economic Role:**

The dual-in game-asset system of [ALLOY](alloy.md) and FURY creates a sustainable gameplay loop. Players use FURY to obtain convenience items and deeper progression that enhance their ability to earn [ALLOY](alloy.md), which can then be exchanged back into FURY. This cycle strengthens player engagement with the game’s ecosystem and ensures that rewards remain tied directly to skills of the players, gameplay activity and progression.
