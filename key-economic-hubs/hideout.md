# Hideout

Your hideout is your personal base and the center of your progression potential. Its modules are critical to your survival and prosperity.

From an in-game economy perspective, three modules are paramount:

**Generator:**

This module powers your entire hideout, including the Engine. It requires Globs of Fuel to operate, creating a constant resource demand you must manage. The generator itself is free, but upgrading it with in-game resources is essential for supporting efficient crafting as well as powering the Engine to keep opening Faction Lockboxes.

**Biolab Module:**

\
This module allows you to combine five shards of the same faction to craft a Faction Lockbox. &#x20;

**Engine:**

This is the module that allows opening Faction Lockboxes and looting the largest amounts of in-game asset ALLOY. It requires an activated Core NFT to work.
