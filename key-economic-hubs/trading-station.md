# Trading Station

Trading Station is where you manage your in-game assets and gear up for the next raid. It contains two main areas: The Council Offerings and The Exchange.

**The Council Offerings**\
The Council Offerings is where players will find rotating selection of high-value items such as essential crafting materials, Globs of Fuel to power your generator and Engine, and tactical consumables for any combat scenario.

**The Exchange**

The Exchange is the only place to exchange between in-game ALLOY assets and the on-chain FURY token. The game operates a Dynamic Conversion System designed to create a fair, competitive, and fun gameplay for players:

1. Rewarding Skill and Timing: The system is built to celebrate the most dedicated and skillful players. The exchange rate between ALLOY and FURY is at its most favorable at the dawn of each new monthly cycle. The pioneers—those who dive in first and dominate the field through game mastery—are recognized.
2. Ensuring Long-Term Value: This dynamic approach protects the entire in-game economy. As the community collectively collects more ALLOY assets, the system automatically adjusts the conversion rate to maintain balance. This includes pre-planned events, where the amount of ALLOY required to exchange for 1 FURY changes. Ratio is set to 1:1 until the first 400,000 ALLOY are acquired; 1:3 for the following 800,000 ALLOY; 1:9 for the next 1,600,000 ALLOY; 1:18 for any remaining ALLOY until the end of monthly cycle, when the in-game economy cycle resets back to ratio to 1:1.
