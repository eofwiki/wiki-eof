**The Council Offerings**\
The Council Offerings is where players will find rotating selection of high-value items such as essential crafting [materials](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/materials), [Globs of Fuel](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/materials) to power your [generator](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/hideout/generator) and [Engine](https://wiki.eof.gg/utility-nfts/engine-and-its-cores), and tactical [consumables](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/healing-items) for any combat scenario.

**The Exchange**

The Exchange is the only place to exchange between in-game [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) assets and the on-chain [FURY token](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md). The game operates a Dynamic Conversion System designed to create a fair, competitive, and fun gameplay for players:

1. Rewarding Skill and Timing: The system is built to celebrate the most dedicated and skillful players. The exchange rate between [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) and [FURY](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md) is at its most favorable at the dawn of each new monthly cycle. The pioneers—those who dive in first and dominate the field through game mastery—are recognized.
2. Ensuring Long-Term Value: This dynamic approach protects the entire in-game economy. As the community collectively collects more [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) assets, the system automatically adjusts the conversion rate to maintain balance. This includes pre-planned events, where the amount of [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) required to exchange for 1 [FURY](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md) changes. Ratio is set to 1:1 until the first 400,000 [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) are acquired; 1:3 for the following 800,000 [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md); 1:9 for the next 1,600,000[ ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md); 1:18 for any remaining [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) until the end of monthly cycle, when the in-game economy cycle resets back to ratio to 1:1.
