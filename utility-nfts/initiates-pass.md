To unlock the most valuable loot in raids, you must first be Initiated by the High Council in Engines of Fury game. The Initiate’s Pass NFT is the entry requirement for accessing higher-tier raid rewards and progression systems.

**Obtaining Initiate's Pass:**
Limited-supply Initiate's Pass NFT can be acquired by:

* By having acquired certain in-game digital assets  (e.g., Council Medallion or Proto Cell).&#x20;
* Through limited access sales carried out on third-party platforms (e.g., TokenTrove), which independently organize and distribute NFTs provided by Engines of Fury.&#x20;
* Through transfers or swaps with other players, including via external platforms, carried out independently at the players’ own discretion and risk.

**Becoming an Initiated Raider:** Once obtained, the NFT must be transferred from your wallet to your in-game inventory and activated on the Initiate Screen to grant you the "Initiated Raider" status. This status is the prerequisite for accessing high-tier economic activities in-game.

**A Window of Opportunity:** The Initiated Raider status allows you to open special Council Caches. This ability is active for 5 hours each day, with the timer starting the moment you enter your first raid of that 24-hour period. After the 5-hour window closes, your status is suspended until the next daily reset.

**What are Council Caches?** These are visually unique lootboxes found during raids that can only be unlocked by Initiated Raiders. Each map contains six Council Caches. At least one is guaranteed to hold a rare Faction Shard, while the others contain a small amount of 1 or 2 ALLOY).

**Fair Play System:** 5-hour timer is tied directly to the Initiate NFT itself, not the player's account. This prevents the NFT from being transfered to another account for immediate use after its daily timer has been exhausted, ensuring a level playing field for all participants and preventing system exploitation.&#x20;
