# Utility NFTs

In Engines of Fury, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) function as in-game utility assets that unlock specific features and progression paths. Each NFT provides access to different parts of the game’s economy and enhances the overall gameplay experience. Their utility is designed to work in combination, encouraging strategic choices and cooperation between players.
