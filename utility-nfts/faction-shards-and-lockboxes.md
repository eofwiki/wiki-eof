# Faction Shards & Lockboxes

Faction Shards are collectible [utility NFTs](./) that can be combined to create Faction Lockboxes. This system is designed to encourage specialization, cooperation, and player-driven exchange both in-game and, where supported, on external platforms.

There are four Faction Shards to collect, each tied to one of the game's core factions: The Forge, Verdant Vanguard, Echelon of Eternity, and The Helix Institute.

**Three primary ways to obtain Faction Shards:**

* **The Initiate's Path:** As an [Initiated Raider](initiates-pass.md), raid the [Fairwater and Cliffside](../game/maps/) maps to find and loot Council Caches. These may contain one of 4 Faction Shards alongside 1 or 2 [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md).
* **The Stalker's Path:** Without an Initiate NFT, players can choose a more direct approach by looking for other raiders (players) in a map and looting their Shards and[ ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md) after successful PVP encounters.
* **The Merchant’s Path:** Players can also obtain Shards from other players, including via external NFT platforms, carried out independently at their own discretion and risk.

**Collect, craft & loot**\
Different Faction Shard drops are random, meaning you will naturally accumulate a mix from all four factions. Once you have collected five shards of the same faction, you can use them to craft a Faction Lockbox NFT in the [Biolab Module](../game/hideout/biolab.md). Faction Lockboxes can then be used in the [Engine](../game/hideout/engine.md) to unlock a random amount of 100 to 10,000 [ALLOY](../economy/dual-currencies/alloy.md).&#x20;
