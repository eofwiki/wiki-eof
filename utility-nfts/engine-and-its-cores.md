# Engine & its Cores

Once you have crafted a [Faction Lockbox](faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md), you need the right tool to open it. [Engine](../game/hideout/engine.md) is a specialized [hideout module](https://wiki.eof.gg/game/hideout), and Engine Core NFTs are the reusable keys that turn it on.

**What is Engine?**&#x20;

[Engine](engine-and-its-cores.md) is a new [hideout module](../game/hideout/) that can unlock [Faction Lockboxes](faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md). To turn on the [Engine](engine-and-its-cores.md), you must insert a [Core](engine-and-its-cores.md). It can be removed from the [Engine](../game/hideout/engine.md) and transferred to other players, including via external platforms, at their own discretion and risk.<br>

**Obtaining an Engine Core:**&#x20;

* Through limited access sales carried out on third-party platforms (e.g., TokenTrove), which independently organize and distribute NFTs provided by Engines of Fury.&#x20;
* Through transfers or swaps with other players, including via external platforms, carried out independently at the players’ own discretion and risk.

**Power Requirements:**&#x20;

Be aware that the [Engine](engine-and-its-cores.md) consumes a significant amount of power. Keeping your hideout's Generator upgraded and carefully planning your [Glob of Fuel](../game/materials.md) usage (or buying it for [$FURY ](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md)in [Trading Station](../key-economic-hubs/trading-station.md)) is essential skill of strategy and planning for continuous operation the Engine module. This adds a resource management layer to your economic strategy.

**Tiers of Efficiency:**

There are three different tiers of Cores available ([Rare Core](engine-and-its-cores.md), [Legendary Core](engine-and-its-cores.md), [Furious Core](engine-and-its-cores.md)), allowing you to unlock one, two, or three [Faction Lockboxes](faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md) simultaneously, while the unlocking time remains the same - 20 hours for one lockbox. This creates a clear path for vertical progression in your resource gathering efficiency.
