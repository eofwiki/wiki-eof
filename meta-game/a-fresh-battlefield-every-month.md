# A Fresh Battlefield Every Month

Each month ends with **The Sporefall**—a recurring event where the atmosphere is choked with alien spores, resetting the ecosystem by killing most life while seeding the next generation.

The world is consumed and reborn, **wiping all character progress and non-tokenised items**. This is the ultimate validation of true asset ownership. All your stash and gear is obliterated, while your permanent assets—your [**Initiate's Pass**](../utility-nfts/initiates-pass.md), [**Faction Shards**](../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md), [**Lockboxes**](../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md), [**Cores**](../utility-nfts/engine-and-its-cores.md), and [**FURY**](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md) —persist. They are secured in your in-game wallet, giving you a critical head start in the new world. Your ownership is validated by survival.

This recurring apocalypse is by design. It crushes stagnation and destroys power creep. The AI of the world learns from your actions, analyzing the last cycle and may evolve against the players and offer a new - increased challenge every time, such as item stats rebalancing, new [talents](../game/talent-system.md), new quests, enemy strength and behaviors to counter previously successful strategies. This ensures the meta is always in flux.

Your old strategies will fail. You must adapt to survive.
