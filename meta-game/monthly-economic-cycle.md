# Monthly Economic Cycle

At the end of each month, the economic cycle undergoes a full reset, most importantly, the dynamic conversion rate, which returns to its most favorable starting point at 1:1. This reset is crucial for maintaining a level playing field, ensuring that every month offers a fresh and equitable opportunity for all participants—veterans and newcomers alike.

A full wipe resets all players in-game progression. The following changes will occur:

* All in-game progress will be wiped.
* All items will be removed from player stashes and inventories, except for [FURY](../economy/dual-currencies/fury.md) and [NFTs](../utility-nfts/) ([Initiate's Pass](../utility-nfts/initiates-pass.md), [Faction Shards](../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md), [Lockboxes](../utility-nfts/faction-shards-and-lockboxes.md), [Cores](../utility-nfts/engine-and-its-cores.md)**)**.
* FURY-to-ALLOY exchange rate will be reset to 1:1.
* All players will start from zero.
